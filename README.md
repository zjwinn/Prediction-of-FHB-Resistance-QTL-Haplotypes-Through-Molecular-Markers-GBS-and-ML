# Profiling of Fusarium Head Blight Resistance QTL Haplotypes Through Molecular Markers, Genotyping-by-Sequencing, and Machine Learning
This is the data repository for the publication of the same name.

In this data repository, I will only be placing the R code and the resulting output. 
Genotype and phenotype information will remain inaccessable due to the propritary nature of the 
dataset.

The .Rmd file labeled "QTL_ML_Imputations_for_SG_2019_2020.Rmd" contains all the code used to run
the analysis featured in the paper. The .zip file labeled "QTL Imputation Methods.zip" contains a PDF
of the markdown of the .Rmd file. In the analysis, a GWAS of selected environments was performed. This
analysis did not make it into the manuscript, but the code and the results are available for viewing.
All other information in the files is relavent.
